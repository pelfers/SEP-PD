## Workshop Descriptions
***
###Days 6-7:

**Lesson Planning Party**
*Facilitators: SEP Staff*
*Room: 820*

From Monday through Thursday, teachers will meet in groups to work on a 15-minute mini lesson addressing one of the SEP units. This mini lesson will be then presented on Friday to their peers and to a group of SEP cohort 1 teachers.

**Paper Circuits**
*Facilitators: Jose and Matt*
*Room: 820*

In this workshop, participants will learn the basics of electricity and using simple materials like copper tape, LEDs, coin cell batteries and paper, they'll create their first working circuit on paper.

**Intro to Physical Computing: Arduino**
*Facilitator: Matt Boyle*
*Room: 820*

Monday

Participants will be introduced to physical computing with Arduino by building a basic circuit on the breadboard first. After theyâ€™ll work through the basics of the Arduino syntax using the Blink code, common functions and commands like setup,, loop, pinMode, digitalWrite, and commenting. At the end of the day participants will have a working circuit consisting of an LED and a potentiometer. 

Tuesday

On the second day, teachers will explore the SIK Guide, build another project (involving two components, like buttons & LEDs) and learn about pedagogy and approaches to other projects, finding other people's code online & adapting it, using libraries, fritzing, among other things.


**Arduino Lab**
*Facilitator: Matt Boyle*
*Room: 820*

###Day 8:

**Computer Science Teaching Strategies**
*Facilitators: Tim Chen and Christa Quint*
*Room: 820*

**CS Lesson Demo**
*Facilitator: Ben SK*
*Room: 820*

**Google Classroom + Assessment Tools**
*Facilitator: Ben SK*
*Room: 820*

###Day 9:

**CS Implementation Lifehacks**
*Facilitator: Matt Boyle*
*Room: 820*

###Day 10:

**Mini lesson demo / teacher feedback**
*Facilitators: Ben SK, Tim Chen and Christa Quint*
*Rooms: 816 and 820*

**Lesson planning for SEP /Ask an expert**
*Rooms: 816 and 820*

An informal meeting of teachers to develop lessons on their topic of choice and present to other teachers for feedback.

**Unconference: Propose and run a session**
*Rooms: TBD*

A chance for teachers to propose and present informally on any topic of their choice related to CS education.
