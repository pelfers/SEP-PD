Host a CS4ALL Hackathon at your school next month! No experience is necessary. In this session, we'll cover expectations, what the DOE can and can't provide for your school's event, as well as take an in-depth look at CS4ALL Hack Pack essentials like student worksheets, the teacher guide, and day-of slideshow.

**Planning + Teacher Feedback**
*Facilitator: Amna and José*
*Room: 3213*

Teacher’s choice: use this time to either work on lesson plans and present to other teachers for feedback or start planning your school hackathon event
