## Workshop Descriptions

### Cohort 2 (6th and 9th):

**Advanced Scratch Pt. III**
*Facilitators: Jason Bissonnette*
*Room: 3213*

Teachers will be introduced to the concept of variables in computer programming and game design principles. Then, they will apply them in their Scratch games. This content is introduced in the SEP Computer Programming curriculum Unit 4, Learning Activity #1.

**Research Alliance for NYC Schools Talk**
*Presenter: Cheri Fancsali*
*Room: 3213*

**SEP Teacher Meetup Info Session**

**CS4All In-School Hackathons**
*Facilitator: Amna*
*Room: 3213*

Host a CS4ALL Hackathon at your school next month! No experience is necessary. In this session, we'll cover expectations, what the DOE can and can't provide for your school's event, as well as take an in-depth look at CS4ALL Hack Pack essentials like student worksheets, the teacher guide, and day-of slideshow.

**Planning + Teacher Feedback**
*Facilitator: Amna and José*
*Room: 3213*

Teacher’s choice: use this time to either work on lesson plans and present to other teachers for feedback or start planning your school hackathon event
