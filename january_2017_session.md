**Let’s make a robot move and solve challenges II**
*Facilitators: EJ Park & Francisco Cervantes*
*Room: 3403*

MS teachers will review basics of LEGO robotics first, then learn more about programming robot’s actions. They will solve given challenges and have a chance to design their own.

**Intro to Python II**
*Facilitators: Tim Chen & Jose Olivares*
*Room: 3213*

Teachers will be introduced to "while loops" and "for loops" in Python by solving a series of unplugged and coding activities.
